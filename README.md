# Catch-em-All-3
Our game features a countdown timer, and the objective is to collect all the diamonds in each round before the timer runs out. Once you successfully collect all the diamonds, you gain an additional 5 seconds for the next round. The challenge is to gather as many diamonds as possible before time runs out.
